# L2O-gas-elec-coordination
This GitHub github contains the codes and data used in the research work entitled "A Learning-to-Optimize Framework for Joint Scheduling in Electricity and Gas Systems" by Chloé Dupont, François Vallée, Bruno François and Jean-François Toubeau submitted for review in the CSEE Journal of Power and Energy Systems

Data are extracted from the provided .XLSX files. 
The predictor tested for our L2O approach are trained offline in a fully data-driven manner. These are provided in the "Predictor Model" file.
Several techniques were used to describe the complex relationship between gas flow and pressure levels in a day-ahead coordinated gas-electricity dispatch. Our L2O approach and some state-of-the-art techniques can be found in "Optimization Model".
